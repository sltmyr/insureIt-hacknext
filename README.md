We have used several services from IBM Cloud incouding Cloud Foundry apps 
for our servers, Functions which are serverless for modular API integrations, 
Watson Visual Recognition services for images analysis, 
Watson Personality Anayzer which we connected wtih LinkedIn and Twitter API
to combine information for making accurate predictions about customer needs, 
Trained custom machine learning model for object recognition and customer demand prediction,
we further tunneled Allianz APi to IBM cloud network as it was restricted to the Hacknext event
